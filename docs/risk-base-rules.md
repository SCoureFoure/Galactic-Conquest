## Equipment

- 1 Tri-fold Game Board (6 continents, 42 territories)
- 5 Dice: 2 white (defender), 3 red (attacker)
- Deck of 56 RISK cards (42 territory cards + 2 wild cards + 12 Secret Mission cards)
- 6 Sets of armies, each a different color

### Army Denominations

| Piece | Value |
|---|---|
| Infantry | 1 army |
| Cavalry | 5 armies |
| Artillery | 10 armies |

You may trade in 5 Infantry for 1 Cavalry, or 2 Cavalry (or 1 Cavalry + 5 Infantry) for 1 Artillery at any time.

### RISK Cards

- 2 "wild" cards marked with all three types but no territory
- 12 Secret Mission cards (used only in Secret Mission RISK variant)

## Object of the Game

To conquer the world by occupying every territory on the board, eliminating all opponents.

---

## Setup — Initial Army Placement

1. Select a color and count out starting armies based on player count:

| Players | Starting Infantry |
|---|---|
| 2 | See 2-player variant |
| 3 | 35 each |
| 4 | 30 each |
| 5 | 25 each |
| 6 | 20 each |

2. Roll one die. Highest roll places first — one Infantry on any territory to claim it.
3. Going left, each player places one army on any unclaimed territory. Continue until all 42 territories are claimed.
4. After all territories are claimed, players take turns placing one additional army on any territory they already occupy. Continue until all armies are placed. No limit per territory.
5. Shuffle RISK card deck (remove Mission cards), place face down as draw pile.
6. Whoever placed the first army takes the first turn.

## Turn Structure

Each turn has three steps, in order:

### 1. Getting and Placing New Armies

Calculate new armies from three sources:

**Territories:** Count territories you occupy, divide by 3 (ignore remainder). Minimum 3 armies per turn.

| Territories | Armies |
|---|---|
| 9 or fewer | 3 (minimum) |
| 11 | 3 |
| 14 | 4 |
| 17 | 5 |

**Continents:** If you control ALL territories of a continent at the start of your turn, receive bonus armies per the board chart.

**RISK Cards:** Trade in matched sets of 3 cards for armies (see RISK Cards section below).

Place all new armies on territories you already occupy.

### 2. Attacking

Attacking is optional. You may attack as many territories as you like, as many times as you like, during your turn.

**Rules for attacking:**

- You may only attack a territory adjacent to one you own (or connected by a dashed line).
- You must have at least 2 armies in the attacking territory (must leave at least 1 behind).
- You may stop attacking at any time.

**To attack:**

1. Announce the attacking territory and the target territory.
2. Both players announce how many dice they will roll.
3. Both roll simultaneously.

**Attacker dice (red):** Roll 1, 2, or 3 dice. Must have at least one more army in the territory than the number of dice rolled.

**Defender dice (white):** Roll 1 or 2 dice. Must have at least 2 armies to roll 2 dice.

**Resolving the roll:**

1. Compare the highest die from each side. If attacker's is higher, defender loses 1 army. If defender's is higher or tied, attacker loses 1 army.
2. If both rolled more than one die, compare the next-highest pair the same way.
3. **Defender wins ties.**
4. Attacker can never lose more than 2 armies per roll.

**Capturing a territory:**

- When the last defending army is eliminated, the attacker captures the territory.
- Move in at least as many armies as dice rolled in the final battle.
- Must always leave at least 1 army in the attacking territory.
- Every territory must always have at least 1 army.

**Ending your attack:**

- You may stop at any time.
- If you captured at least one territory this turn, draw one RISK card (only one per turn, regardless of territories captured).

**Eliminating an opponent:**

- If you eliminate a player (defeat their last army), you take all their RISK cards.
- If this gives you 6+ cards, you must immediately trade in sets until you have 4 or fewer.
- If fewer than 6, wait until your next turn to trade.

### 3. Fortifying Your Position

At the end of your turn, you may optionally make one "free move":

- Move as many armies as you like from ONE territory to ONE adjacent territory you own.
- Must leave at least 1 army behind.
- You do NOT need to have attacked or won a battle to fortify.

---

## RISK Cards

**Earning cards:** At the end of any turn where you captured at least one territory, draw one card.

**Matched sets** (any of these combinations):

- 3 cards of the same type (Infantry, Cavalry, or Artillery)
- 1 of each type
- Any 2 cards + 1 wild card

**Trading in:** You may trade a set at the start of your turn. You MUST trade if you have 5 or 6 cards.

**Set values** (global counter — tracks all sets traded by any player):

| Set # | Armies |
|---|---|
| 1st | 4 |
| 2nd | 6 |
| 3rd | 8 |
| 4th | 10 |
| 5th | 12 |
| 6th | 15 |
| 7th+ | +5 each (20, 25, 30...) |

**Territory bonus:** If any of the 3 traded cards shows a territory you currently occupy, place 2 extra armies on that territory. Max 2 extra armies per turn from this bonus.

---

## Winning

First player to occupy all 42 territories wins.

---

## Variant: 2-Player RISK

Played like standard RISK with a third "neutral" army set acting as a buffer.

**Setup:**

1. Remove Mission cards and wild cards. Shuffle and deal into 3 equal piles of 14 cards.
2. Each player picks a pile. Remaining pile is "neutral."
3. Place 1 army on each of your 14 territories. Place 1 neutral army on each of the 14 neutral territories.
4. Take turns placing remaining armies: 2 of yours on your territories, then 1 neutral on any neutral territory.
5. Return wild cards to deck, shuffle, and play.

**Attacking:** You may attack neutral territories. Your opponent rolls defense for neutral territories. Neutral armies never attack and never get reinforcements.

**Winning:** Eliminate your opponent (capture all their territories). You do NOT need to eliminate neutral armies.

---

## Variant: Capital RISK (Shorter Game)

**Object:** Capture all opposing Headquarters while controlling your own.

**Shorter option:**
- 4 players: Capture any 2 opposing HQs while holding your own.
- 5-6 players: Capture any 3 opposing HQs while holding your own.

**Setup:** After normal army deployment, each player secretly selects one of their territories as Headquarters by placing its matching RISK card face down. All reveal simultaneously.

**Special rules:**
- Capturing an opponent's HQ: take their HQ card face up as proof.
- Losing your HQ does NOT eliminate you — give your card to the captor and keep playing.
- HQ cards cannot be used in matched sets.

---

## Variant: Secret Mission RISK (3-6 Players)

**Object:** Complete your secret mission first.

**Setup:** Uses 12 Mission cards. One dealt to each player face down. Territories dealt evenly via RISK cards. Armies placed on dealt territories.

**Winning:** First to complete their mission and reveal the card wins. Other players can inadvertently help you complete your mission.

## Rules Variations for RISK Experts

### Card Set Values

Instead of the standard escalation, increase by only 1 per set: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

### Fortifying Your Position (Extended)

At end of turn, move armies from one or more territories to any number of your other territories — but you must own all territories along a continuous path between them.

### Armies Per Territory

Max 12 armies on a single territory. Excess armies are lost.

### Advantage When Attacking (Territory Cards)

If you hold a RISK card showing the territory you're attacking from OR attacking:
- You may re-roll any one die per battle involving that territory.
- Place the card face up while using it; return to hand when you stop attacking that territory.
- One card per battle, but multiple cards per turn.
- Cannot be used when defending.

### Commanders

Once per turn while attacking, you may change one of the dice you've just rolled to show "6". Represents your Commander's influence at the battle.
