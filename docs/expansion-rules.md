# Galactic Conquest — Expansion Rules

**Read the complete World Domination RISK rules first.**

Galactic Conquest layers new mechanics onto the base RISK game. All standard RISK rules apply unless explicitly changed below. When no upgrades are active, combat behaves identically to base RISK.

---

## New Equipment

In addition to standard RISK equipment, each player receives:

- 1 Command Ship token
- 1 Command Ship card (tracks current tier and abilities)
- Planet Upgrade tokens (Shield Generator, Orbital Battery, Fortress)

---

## New Concepts

### Territories Are Planets

All references to "territories" in the base rules now refer to **planets**. Continents are **sectors**. The map is a star chart. Adjacency represents hyperspace lane connections between planets.

### Command Ship

Each player begins the game with one **Command Ship**. The Command Ship is a special unit that:

- Occupies a planet (placed on the board like an army, but does not count as an army)
- Can move further than normal armies
- Provides a combat bonus when present at a battle
- Can be destroyed if the planet it occupies is captured

The Command Ship is the core attacker upgrade. It represents your fleet's flagship and its commander.

### Planet Upgrades

Planets can be improved with defensive structures. These are the core defender upgrades. They represent permanent installations that protect a planet's garrison.

---

## Setup

Follow standard RISK setup with these additions:

1. After all armies are placed, each player places their Command Ship on any planet they occupy.
2. All Command Ships start at **Tier 1 (Captain)**.

---

## Turn Structure

Each turn follows the base RISK structure with modifications:

1. **Reinforce** — Get and place new armies (standard RISK rules)
2. **Command** — Move your Command Ship *(new phase)*
3. **Attack** — Attack adjacent planets (modified by Command Ship and planet upgrades)
4. **Fortify** — Move armies between adjacent planets (standard RISK rules)
5. **Build** — Construct or upgrade planet structures *(new phase)*

### Phase 2: Command (New)

During the Command phase, you may move your Command Ship up to **3 planets** along a connected path of planets you control.

Rules:

- The Command Ship may only travel through planets you occupy.
- The Command Ship does not carry armies with it — it moves independently.
- You are not required to move the Command Ship.
- The Command Ship may move before or after you attack, but only once per turn. *(Playtest note: currently placed before attacking for simplicity.)*

### Phase 3: Attack (Modified)

All base RISK attack rules apply. The following modifications are added based on upgrades:

**If your Command Ship is on the attacking planet:**

- One of your attack dice is upgraded based on your Command Ship's tier (see Command Ship Tiers below).
- This replaces one of your standard d6 dice — it does not add an extra die.
- The upgraded die is always used as one of the dice compared in the highest pair.

**If the defending planet has structures:**

- Structures provide defensive bonuses during combat (see Planet Upgrades below).
- Structure effects apply every round of combat, not just the first.

**All other attack rules remain unchanged:**

- Attacker rolls up to 3 dice, defender rolls up to 2 dice.
- Defender wins ties.
- Attacker must leave at least 1 army behind.
- Attacker may retreat after any round.

### Phase 5: Build (New)

At the end of your turn, you may build **one** planet upgrade on any planet you control. Each planet may hold a maximum of **3 structures** (one of each type).

Building costs are paid from your reinforcement pool for next turn. *(Playtest note: cost system TBD — may use card trade-ins, flat army cost, or free with cooldown.)*

---

## Command Ship Tiers

Your Command Ship can be upgraded during the game. Higher tiers replace one attack die with a more powerful die.

| Tier | Title | Die | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Captain | d8 | Replaces one d6 with a d8 when attacking |
| 2 | General | d10 | Replaces one d6 with a d10 when attacking |
| 3 | Admiral | d12 | Replaces one d6 with a d12 when attacking |

**Upgrading your Command Ship:**

- *(Playtest note: Upgrade trigger TBD. Options under consideration: spend card sets, capture N planets in one turn, control a sector, or automatic progression at turn thresholds.)*

**Important rules:**

- You have exactly one Command Ship. If the planet it occupies is captured, the Command Ship is **destroyed**.
- A destroyed Command Ship returns at the start of your next turn at Tier 1, placed on any planet you control.
- The Command Ship only provides its bonus when **attacking from** the planet it occupies. It provides no defensive bonus.
- The Command Ship does not count as an army for any purpose (minimum garrisons, dice count, etc.).

---

## Planet Upgrades

Planets can be upgraded with defensive structures. These provide bonuses to the **defender** during combat on that planet.

### Shield Generator

> *Planetary energy shield absorbs incoming fire.*

- **Effect:** Negates 1 defender loss per combat round.
- If the defender would lose armies from a dice comparison, 1 of those losses is absorbed.
- Does not affect attacker losses.

### Orbital Battery

> *Automated weapons platform in high orbit.*

- **Effect:** The defender rolls +1 extra die when defending this planet.
- Standard RISK limits the defender to 2 dice. With an Orbital Battery, the defender may roll up to **3 dice** (if they have at least 3 armies).
- The third die is compared against the attacker's third-highest die (if the attacker rolled 3 dice).

### Fortress

> *Deep underground bunker complex protects garrison troops.*

- **Effect:** Negates 1 defender loss per combat round (stacks with Shield Generator).
- Works identically to Shield Generator — a second layer of absorption.

### Structure Rules

- Each planet may have at most **one of each structure** (max 3 structures per planet).
- Structures are permanent — they are not destroyed when a planet changes hands. *(Playtest note: this may change. Options: structures destroyed on capture, structures disabled for one turn, or structures persist.)*
- Structures only benefit the current occupier of the planet.
- Structures have no effect on attack — they are purely defensive.

### Stacking Example

A planet with Shield Generator + Fortress + Orbital Battery:

- Defender rolls up to 3 dice (Orbital Battery)
- After dice comparison, 2 defender losses are absorbed per round (Shield Generator + Fortress)
- Attacker losses are unaffected

---

## Fortify Phase (Unchanged)

Standard RISK fortify rules apply: move any number of armies from one planet to one adjacent planet you control. Must leave at least 1 army behind.

*(Playtest note: the Expert RISK variant allowing movement along a connected path is under consideration for future inclusion.)*

---

## RISK Cards (Unchanged)

All standard RISK card rules apply: earning cards, trading sets, escalating army values.

*(Playtest note: territory card advantage-when-attacking variant from Expert RISK rules may be adapted as "Tactical Cards" in a future expansion.)*

---

## Winning (Unchanged)

First player to occupy all planets wins.

*(Playtest note: Capital RISK variant — capture opposing Command Ship home planets — is under consideration as an alternate win condition for shorter games.)*

---

## Summary of Changes from Base RISK

| Rule | Base RISK | Galactic Conquest |
|---|---|---|
| Attack dice | Up to 3d6 | Up to 3 dice; one may be d8/d10/d12 if Command Ship is present |
| Defend dice | Up to 2d6 | Up to 3d6 if Orbital Battery is present |
| Defender losses | As rolled | May be reduced by absorption (Shield Generator, Fortress) |
| Tie resolution | Defender wins | Defender wins (unchanged) |
| Special units | None | Command Ship (1 per player, attacker-only) |
| Planet upgrades | None | Up to 3 structures per planet (defender-only) |
| Movement | Fortify 1-to-1 adjacent | Armies: same. Command Ship: up to 3 along owned path |
| New turn phase | None | Command (move ship) and Build (place structures) |

---

## Known Balance Issues (Active Playtesting)

These values are still being tuned:

- **Admiral (d12) vs no structures:** ~92% attacker win rate at 10v10. The top-tier Command Ship is dominant without defensive counterplay.
- **Single absorb structure vs no hero:** ~0% attacker win rate at 10v10. Absorption of 1 loss per round is too strong against baseline armies.
- **Orbital Battery alone:** ~11% attacker win rate at 10v10. Strong but beatable — feels appropriately powerful.
- **Target:** Fully upgraded attacker (Admiral + max bonuses) vs fully upgraded defender (all 3 structures) at equal army counts should approach **50/50**.
- **Absorption tuning:** The "absorb N losses per round" model may need to become probabilistic (e.g., 50% chance to absorb) or limited-use (absorb first N losses per battle, then spent) to avoid making fortified planets invincible.

---

## Design Philosophy

> Structures should "blunt the damage, not disallow it." A fortified planet should feel like it can take a lot of punches — not dodge them.

> The Command Ship should feel like a decisive strategic asset — powerful when positioned correctly, vulnerable when overextended, and devastating when it arrives at the right battle at the right time.

> Base RISK probabilities must be preserved when no upgrades are active. The game should feel like RISK at the start and diverge as players invest in upgrades.
