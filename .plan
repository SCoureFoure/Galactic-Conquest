## Plan: Move balance tuning sliders into attacker/defender panels

### Goal
Move each balance slider into the panel of the side it tunes. Remove the standalone "Balance Tuning" panel. Attacker-related tuning lives in the Attacker panel, defender-related tuning lives in the Defender panel.

### Changes

**1. app.py — Split slider specs by side**
- Replace `_balance_slider_specs()` with `_attacker_slider_specs()` and `_defender_slider_specs()`
- Attacker sliders: attacker_ability, hero_upgrade_level, hero_value_per_upgrade
- Defender sliders: defender_ability, planet_upgrade_level, planet_value_per_upgrade
- Pass both to template as `attacker_sliders` and `defender_sliders`

**2. templates/index.html — Reorganize panels**
- Attacker panel: units, commander dropdown, then a "Tuning" sub-section with attacker sliders + effective attacker bonus display
- Defender panel: units, structure checkboxes, planet upgrade mode dropdown, then a "Tuning" sub-section with defender sliders + effective defender bonus display
- Remove the standalone `<div class="balance-panel">` entirely
- Keep small "defaults = baseline Risk" note in each panel's tuning section
- JS: `refreshBalanceSummary()` updates per-panel bonus displays instead of the old shared summary

**3. static/style.css — Adjust styles**
- Add `.panel-tuning` section styling (compact grid within panels)
- Remove or repurpose `.balance-panel`, `.balance-grid`, `.balance-summary` styles
- Keep `.balance-item`, `.balance-help` styles (reused inside panels)

### No engine changes needed
This is purely UI reorganization — all `data-balance-key` attributes and `getBalanceConfig()` JS function stay the same.
